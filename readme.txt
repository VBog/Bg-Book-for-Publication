The plugin helps you to publish big book with a detailed structure of chapters and sections and forms table of contents of the book.

== Description ==

When you save a post, the plugin splits it into pages and adds a table of contents in the form of a spoiler to the top of each page.

On the post editing page you can set the maximum level of headers included in the table of contents and the level of headings where you break the pages (see screenshot).

You can set the header levels from 1 to 6, and also disable the action of the plug-in for this post by unchecking the item 'this post is book'.

You can also set the author of the published book, which will be listed directly in the post title.

To customize the post appearance, you can use the following classes:
1. bg_bpub_toc - class of contaner (div) with table of contents.
2. bg_bpub_toc_h1 ... bg_bpub_toc_h6 - classes of chapter headers in table of contents.
3. bg_bpub_book_author - class of contaner (span) with name of book author.
